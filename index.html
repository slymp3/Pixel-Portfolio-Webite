      <h3>What are RuneSprites?</h3>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Why did RuneSprites use the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol?</h3>
      <p>RuneSprites utilizes the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol to mint NFTs directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain, providing each satoshi with a unique identity. This protocol ensures the authenticity and permanence of RuneSprites by embedding them directly into the Bitcoin blockchain, enhancing marketability and desirability.</p>
      <p>The Ordinals protocol assigns unique IDs to each satoshi, recording them on the Bitcoin blockchain to verify authenticity and ensure the correct Bitcoin ordinal series. This process makes RuneSprites immutable and resistant to modification.</p>
